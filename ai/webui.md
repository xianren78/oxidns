# WebUI Guidelines

Paths in this guide are relative to `webui/` unless stated otherwise.

## Structure & Commands

- `webui/` contains the Next.js-based management console for OxiDNS. Treat it as a separate frontend workspace that mirrors the plugin model exposed by the Rust server.
- `app/` uses the Next App Router. The `(console)` route group owns the console shell, dashboard, plugin center, settings page, and full-screen config editor mode.
- `components/` contains feature components, while `components/ui/` contains shadcn/Radix-style primitives. Prefer composing existing primitives before adding new low-level UI.
- `components/plugins/` contains plugin-center rendering. Generic card/detail templates live there, and per-plugin overrides live under `components/plugins/kinds/`.
- `lib/plugin-definitions/` is the source of truth for WebUI plugin kinds, labels, icons, descriptions, and config schemas. Each category has its own file (`executor.ts`, `matcher.ts`, `provider.ts`, `server.ts`); `lib/plugin-definitions.ts` aggregates and exports them all as `pluginKindDefinitions`.
- `lib/plugin-definitions/docs.ts` holds fallback field-level documentation keyed by plugin kind; it is merged automatically via `withFieldDocs()`. Localized user-facing docs live under `lib/i18n/locales/*/docs.ts`.
- `lib/i18n/` contains locale state, translation keys, localized WebUI copy, localized plugin definitions, and localized plugin field docs. Keep it aligned whenever adding user-facing UI text or plugin metadata.
- `lib/store.ts` contains the current client state model with Zustand. Backend API wiring should replace mock actions behind this store shape where possible instead of scattering fetch logic through views.
- `lib/auth-store.ts` owns the persisted multi-endpoint model (`endpoints` and `activeEndpointId`). API helpers resolve the active endpoint at request time, while the connection epoch invalidates polling and streaming work when operators switch instances.
- `pnpm dev` runs the WebUI development server with Turbopack.
- `pnpm build` builds the WebUI for production.
- `pnpm typecheck` runs TypeScript validation.
- `pnpm lint` runs ESLint for the WebUI.
- `pnpm format` formats TypeScript and TSX with Prettier and Tailwind class ordering.

## Coding Style

- WebUI code is TypeScript + React. Use `PascalCase` for components, `camelCase` for props/functions, and colocate feature-only helpers near the feature.
- Prefer named exports for shared WebUI components and helpers.
- Use the `@/` path alias for WebUI imports instead of deep relative paths.
- Keep WebUI files client/server explicit: add `"use client"` only for components that need hooks, browser state, event handlers, Zustand, or theme APIs.
- Do not hard-code user-facing copy in components, stores, API helpers, or plugin views. Add translation keys and locale resources instead, while canonical protocol/config tokens such as plugin kinds, YAML keys, DNS record types, metric names, and plugin type labels like `Server`, `Executor`, `Matcher`, and `Provider` may remain literal when they are part of the domain model.
- Use `lucide-react` icons for toolbar actions, navigation, and plugin visuals when an icon exists.

## Internationalization

- Default locale is `zh-CN`, with `en-US` support. When adding or changing WebUI text, update `lib/i18n/keys.ts`, `lib/i18n/locales/zh-CN/webui.ts`, and `lib/i18n/locales/en-US/webui.ts` in the same change.
- Use `useI18n()` inside React components and read `t`, `locale`, `formatNumber`, and `formatDateTime` from that hook. Use `tClient()` only in non-component code that cannot access the provider, such as Zustand store actions, API helpers, or pure utility paths.
- Keep interpolation placeholders stable across locales (`{name}`, `{count}`, `{version}`, etc.) and pass values through `t(key, params)`. Do not build translated sentences by concatenating fragments in JSX.
- Use `formatNumber()` and `formatDateTime()` for user-visible numbers and timestamps when the active locale matters. Avoid direct `toLocaleString()` calls unless the locale is explicitly supplied.
- Keep plugin config schemas in `lib/plugin-definitions/` domain-focused and language-neutral where possible. Put localized plugin names, descriptions, field labels, placeholders, option labels, metric labels/help, derived metric labels, and quick-setup placeholders in `lib/i18n/locales/*/plugin-defined.ts`.
- Put localized field-level documentation in `lib/i18n/locales/*/docs.ts`. When a plugin kind, config field, metric, or docs entry is added/renamed, update both `zh-CN` and `en-US` resources together.
- Use locale-aware plugin helpers such as `getLocalizedPluginKindDefinitions()`, `getLocalizedPluginKindDefinition()`, `pluginTypeLabel()`, `pluginStatusLabel()`, and `getPluginSearchText()` for catalogs, forms, search, CodeMirror completions, cards, and detail views.
- Search indexes, placeholders, empty states, validation messages, toast/dialog copy, accessibility labels, `sr-only` text, tooltips, document title, and meta description are all user-facing and should be localized.
- Leave machine-readable values unlocalized: YAML field names, plugin `kind` values, tags, API payload keys, route paths, enum values sent to the backend, Prometheus metric identifiers, DNS qtypes/rcodes, and configuration examples that users must paste verbatim.

## Architecture & Extension Principles

- Preserve the console shell flow: `app/(console)/layout.tsx -> AppSidebar/AppHeader -> page content -> PluginDetailSheet`, with `ConfigEditorView` taking over the main area when `editorMode` is enabled.
- Keep endpoint selection in the console shell. Switching endpoints must remain client-side, abort endpoint-scoped streams, and trigger authoritative config/runtime refreshes through the existing stores rather than duplicating backend state in pages.
- Keep global UI state in `useAppStore` until backend integration introduces a clearer API boundary. Avoid duplicating selected plugin, drawer state, editor mode, or restart/save flags in page-local stores.
- Treat `PluginInstance` in `lib/types.ts` as the UI model for live plugin instances. Keep its `type` aligned with OxiDNS plugin categories: `server`, `executor`, `matcher`, and `provider`.
- **Adding a new plugin kind to the schema registry requires one definition-file change.** Add the definition to the appropriate category file in `lib/plugin-definitions/` (`executor.ts`, `matcher.ts`, `provider.ts`, or `server.ts`). Everything below auto-derives from that definition with no further registration:
  - Plugin catalog and type-filtered lists (`pluginCatalog`, `getPluginCatalogItemsByType`)
  - Create-plugin dialog (search, listing, schema-driven form)
  - Default card and detail drawer (`PluginCardTemplate`, `PluginDetailTemplate`)
  - Plugin index panel (kind-to-category mapping)
  - Sequence composer and quick-setup insertion
  - YAML editor completions and inline validation
- New or changed plugin definitions still need i18n resources for user-facing labels, descriptions, field text, metric text, and docs. Update `lib/i18n/locales/zh-CN/` and `lib/i18n/locales/en-US/` alongside the schema change.
- Two optional follow-up steps exist for richer UI: (1) create `components/plugins/kinds/<kind>.tsx` with custom `Card`/`Detail` components and register it in `components/plugins/registry.ts`; (2) add fallback field-level docs to `lib/plugin-definitions/docs.ts` when a non-localized fallback is useful. Both fall back gracefully if omitted.
- Use `ConfigField` schemas for plugin configuration instead of hand-built one-off forms whenever possible. This keeps create/edit behavior consistent and preserves YAML/plugin concepts like references, arrays, objects, records, durations, and JSON fields.
- Use `ConfigField.advanced` for optional tuning, timeout, queue, cache, transport override, lifecycle, and legacy compatibility fields. Keep required fields, primary targets, rule data, chain-control fields such as `short_circuit`, and safety-significant behavior visible. The generic editor honors this metadata at the top level and inside nested object/array-object schemas; custom plugin editors must reuse `AdvancedSettingsSection` for the same behavior.
- New-plugin forms keep advanced sections collapsed and display schema defaults without materializing them for untouched advanced fields. Existing plugin forms automatically reveal a section when its serialized YAML explicitly contains any advanced field, including an explicit default, `false`, `0`, or an empty object. Collapsing a section must never remove or rewrite its values.
- Use `referenceTypes`, `referencePrefix`, and `allowInvert` for fields that point to other plugins or matcher expressions. Do not encode `$tag` and `!$tag` handling in individual plugin components unless the schema editor cannot represent the shape.
- Put optional custom plugin visuals in `components/plugins/kinds/<kind>.tsx` and register them in `components/plugins/registry.ts`. If a custom component does not add meaningful clarity, rely on `PluginCardTemplate` and `PluginDetailTemplate`.
- Keep plugin cards focused on scanability: name, category, kind, status/primary metric, and compact operational controls. Push detailed configuration, charts, and destructive actions into the detail sheet.
- Keep `CreatePluginDialog` catalog-driven. Search should cover kind, display name, description, type label, and config fields so operators can find plugins by the concept they remember.
- When replacing mock data with real APIs, keep network calls outside low-level UI primitives and preserve optimistic UI only where the backend operation is reversible or clearly reported.

## Design Principles

- The WebUI is an operational DNS console, not a marketing site. Prioritize dense, calm, scan-friendly screens over decorative layouts.
- Preserve the current visual language: dark mode by default, light mode supported, OKLCH design tokens in `app/globals.css`, teal/green primary accents, restrained borders, muted surfaces, and compact spacing.
- Use shadcn/Radix primitives from `components/ui/` for buttons, dialogs, sheets, tabs, tables, inputs, tooltips, badges, sidebars, and forms. Extend primitives only when repeated product behavior needs it.
- Prefer full-width work surfaces and simple sections. Use cards for individual repeated items, metrics, dialogs, and framed editor/helper panels; avoid nesting cards inside cards.
- Keep navigation persistent and predictable: sidebar for main sections, header for breadcrumbs and global actions, sheets/dialogs for focused secondary workflows.
- Use icon buttons with tooltips for compact global actions such as theme switching, restart, view mode, and editor mode. Include `sr-only` text for icon-only buttons.
- Keep typography compact: page headings around `text-lg`, operational labels at `text-sm`/`text-xs`, plugin tags and config keys in mono where useful. Do not use oversized hero typography inside the console.
- Ensure responsive behavior for desktop and narrow screens with stable grids (`sm`, `lg`, `xl`) and fixed-width side panels only when there is enough viewport room. Avoid layouts where labels, buttons, or badges can overlap.
- Use semantic status color sparingly: primary for active/healthy emphasis, destructive for dangerous actions, yellow/amber only for unsaved or warning states, muted foreground for secondary metadata.
- Use the shared `warning` color token for `always_false`, and the `destructive` token for the higher-risk `always_true` mode. Represent fixed Boolean values with off/on toggle icons; use a neutral controls icon for `normal`. Both fixed modes require confirmation, while restoring `normal` does not. Confirmation copy must state how positive and negated references behave.
- Do not add gradient blobs, decorative illustrations, or broad one-color themes. The interface should feel like a precise control surface for OxiDNS.

## Testing & Documentation

- For WebUI behavior changes, run at least `pnpm typecheck`. Also run `pnpm lint` when changing shared components, route layouts, or plugin form logic.
- For visual WebUI changes, verify the affected route in both light and dark themes, and check narrow and desktop widths for overflow, clipped labels, and broken grid/card layouts.
- If a Rust plugin is added, renamed, or its config shape changes, update the appropriate file in `lib/plugin-definitions/`, the matching i18n resources under `lib/i18n/locales/*/plugin-defined.ts` and `lib/i18n/locales/*/docs.ts`, and optionally `lib/plugin-definitions/docs.ts` in the same change so the console stays aligned with runtime behavior. Custom kind components under `components/plugins/kinds/` only need updating if they reference removed or renamed fields.
- If WebUI architecture, styling tokens, plugin schema conventions, or console workflows change, update this `ai/webui.md` file.
