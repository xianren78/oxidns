# OxiDNS

**A high-performance DNS policy orchestration engine for complex networks.**

OxiDNS is a plugin-driven DNS engine built with Rust for software routers, OpenWrt, homelabs, and advanced self-hosted networks. Declarative policies compose matching, caching, forwarding, fallback, rewriting, local answers, and system integrations, while the WebUI, management API, query records, Prometheus metrics, and real-time logs provide the control plane.

Inspired by [mosdns](https://github.com/IrineSistiana/mosdns), OxiDNS goes beyond rule-based forwarding: requests, upstream responses, and network side effects share one composable and explainable policy pipeline, so complex behavior can still be configured, validated, and traced.

[Quick Start](https://oxidns.org/en/quickstart) · [Configuration](https://oxidns.org/en/configuration) · [Common Scenarios](https://oxidns.org/en/scenarios) · [Performance and Benchmarks](https://oxidns.org/en/benchmarks)

## Why OxiDNS

- **Composable policy**: `sequence` combines matchers, executors, and providers into reusable branches, jumps, and fallback chains.
- **Explainable decisions**: Query records, execution paths, structured logs, and metrics show what matched, what ran, and why a result was selected.
- **Unified ingress and egress**: One policy serves UDP, TCP, DoT, DoQ, and DoH while upstream resolution, connection reuse, concurrent selection, and proxy egress stay centrally managed.
- **DNS-driven networking**: Resolution results can update Linux `ipset` / `nftset`, RouterOS address lists and static routes, HTTP webhooks, and external scripts.

OxiDNS has its own DNS message and wire codec, and moves rule compilation, dependency analysis, and connection initialization out of the request hot path whenever possible. See [Performance and Benchmarks](https://oxidns.org/en/benchmarks) for the methodology and historical results.

The request path stays explicit:

```text
client -> server -> sequence (matcher + executor + provider)
                         |-> upstream / local answer -> response
                         `-> side effects
```

## What a policy looks like

This configuration sends `corp.lan` to an internal resolver and everything else to an encrypted upstream. Providers, matchers, executors, and servers compose through tags instead of embedding policy in protocol listeners:

```yaml
plugins:
  - tag: internal_domains
    type: domain_set
    args:
      exps: ["domain:corp.lan"]

  - tag: forward_internal
    type: forward
    args:
      upstreams:
        - addr: "udp://192.168.1.1:53"

  - tag: forward_public
    type: forward
    args:
      upstreams:
        - addr: "tls://dns.quad9.net:853"
          bootstrap: "9.9.9.9:53"

  - tag: main
    type: sequence
    args:
      - matches: "qname $internal_domains"
        exec: "$forward_internal"
      - matches: "!has_resp"
        exec: "$forward_public"
      - exec: accept

  - tag: dns_server
    type: udp_server
    args:
      entry: main
      listen: ":5335"
```

See [Configuration](https://oxidns.org/en/configuration) and [Common Scenarios](https://oxidns.org/en/scenarios) for the complete structure, reusable rules, and deployment patterns.

## Quick Start

Install the latest release with one command. By default this installs and starts OxiDNS as a system service:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://oxidns.org/install.sh | sudo sh
```

Elevated Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
irm https://oxidns.org/install.ps1 | iex
```

By default, the installer downloads the matching release, installs the WebUI, and registers and starts the system service.

After installation, verify the management endpoint and the default DNS service:

```bash
curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:9199/api/health
dig @127.0.0.1 example.com
dig @127.0.0.1 example.com +tcp
```

The WebUI is available at `http://SERVER_IP:9199/` by default. Before allowing access from other devices, enable `api.http.auth` and restrict sources with a firewall or reverse proxy. Run `oxidns check` after changing configuration.

On OpenWrt, the same installer installs [`luci-app-oxidns`](https://github.com/svenshi/luci-app-oxidns). Use the [Quick Start](https://oxidns.org/en/quickstart) for the first successful query; see “Installation & Deployment” in the manual for archives, Docker, Debian packages, portable installs, and uninstallation; see [Custom Build](https://oxidns.org/en/custom-build) to strip optional protocols and plugins.

## Who it is for

OxiDNS fits long-running DNS environments that need fine-grained control and complete observability, including:

- Home gateways, software routers, OpenWrt, NAS, and homelabs
- Policy routing by domain, client, query type, or response result
- Multi-upstream racing, fallback, encrypted DNS, and custom egress
- Ad filtering, local overrides, dual-stack preference, ECS, and dynamic rule learning
- DNS-driven firewall sets, address lists, and policy routes

It is not an authoritative DNS server or a zero-configuration ad-blocking dashboard. If ready-made graphical management is your primary requirement, a product focused on that experience may be a better fit. OxiDNS is for users willing to trade some configuration complexity for control and explainability.

## Project Status

OxiDNS is under active development and is suitable for advanced home networks, software routers, homelabs, and other controlled self-hosted environments. Before using it in production or critical networks, validate configuration and fallback behavior, assess capacity, and put monitoring in place. DNS changes directly affect network availability, so keep a recoverable configuration and bypass path.

Issues, real-world feedback, documentation improvements, and plugin contributions are welcome.
